// Your goal is to analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:

// Get the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments with more points_possible should be counted for more e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%. Each assignment should have a key with its ID and the value associated with it should be the percentage that the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)

// Each assignment should have a key with its ID (1, 2, or 3) and the value of the learner's score on that particular assignment = 1: .90, 2: .87

// if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
// the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
// } ---?? Come back to this
